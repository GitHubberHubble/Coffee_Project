# Coffee_Project
reminds you to sip on your coffee.
It is just a little joke, but when I finished my own Discord-Bot your would be able to download the sourcecode from here.

Once you have downloaded the zip file, open it and open the folder inside it. In this folder you will find the valid license as well as a README and another .zip file. They can now unpack in any directory and run the exe there.
